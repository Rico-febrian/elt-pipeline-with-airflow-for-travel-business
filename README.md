## ⚠️ Work in Progress

**Due to hardware limitations (low-spec laptop), running WSL, Docker Desktop (Airflow), and VS Code simultaneously causes severe lag. The Airflow container becomes very slow, often resulting in repeated DAG errors. As a workaround, tasks have to be run manually one by one, which is time-consuming.**

**Still trying to find a better solution for this.**
